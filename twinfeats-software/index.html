      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>
        Twin Brothers Kent & Kevin Smotherman founded TwinFeats Software in 1993 with a simple premise: Free software for a free world. From the beginning on the Commodore 64 to today's Android apps, that vision has never waivered.

      <h1>Services</h1>
      <p>
        TwinFeats Software creates innovative, custom web applications which will meet and exceed expectations. We will work with you to fully understand your needs, but more than that - your data. Web applications are all about data, and without deeply understanding the needs of your data, your web application will suffer.
      </p>
      <h2>Web applications? Huh?</h2>
      <p>
        Web Sites are static. The content they display doesn't change dynamically. A web site powered by a database. Facebook is a great example of a web application - the data shown varies by user and can change every single second.

      <h1>Applications</h1>
      <p>
        We've written so many applications in the last 35+ years that we have literally lost count! Applications like our FreedomWare line of games for the Commodore 64 and are long gone, as are our productivity suite for GEOS on the C64 and Amiga.

        Ever use WebEx, GotoMeeting, or Zoom teleconferencing software? We wrote our own back in the 90s for not just conferencing, but online learning. Our Android application range from custom games to productivity tools. Web Sites and Web Applications? We've done them by the dozens.

        As we like to say, if we can't do it at TwinFeats Software, it's a hardware problem.
